" Makes <C-H> in insert mode delete one subword from a camel case word or one
" _ delimited subword before the cursor.
"
" Default mapping could be changed by setting g:EraseSubword_insertMap to the
" desired key.  Setting s:EraseSubword_insertMap to an empty string would
" remove default mapping at all.  Mapping could be changed later (for example
" in file type plugin or in some auto commands) using
" EraseSubword_setInsertMap function that takes one argument - new value for
" the g:EraseSubword_insertMap.  Empty value would disable plugin and any
" other value would add new mapping (old mapping would be removed).
"
" There is also a possibility to use buffer local mapping.  Than you probably
" want to set g:EraseSubword_insertMap to an empty string (so that there would
" be no global mapping) and then use EraseSubword_setlocalInsertMap in
" FileType auto command or BufNew, BufCreate and a like to set buffer local
" mapping.  EraseSubword_setlocalInsertMap uses same syntax as
" EraseSubword_insertMap - one argument that is a desired mapping or empty
" string to remove existing mapping.
"
"
" Work as follows:
"
" 1. If cursor is in the first column then if 'backspace' contains eol and
" current line is not the first line of the buffer current line is joined with
" the previous one.  Stop.
"
" 2. If a character to the left of the cursor is not in 'iskeyword' then all
" characters up to the start of the current line that is not in 'iskeyword'
" are deleted.  Stop.
"
" 3. If a character to the left of the cursor is in 'iskeyword' then
"
"   3.1. If there is one or more "_" characters to the left of the cursor then
"   remove them all.
"
"   3.2. If a character to the left of the cursor is an uppercase one then all
"   the uppercase characters that is in 'iskeyword' up to the start of the
"   current line is deleted.  Stop.
"
"   3.3. If a character to the left of the cursor is not an uppercase one then
"   erase all the 'iskeyword' characters up to the uppercase one or up to the
"   _.  If erasing was stopped on an uppercase character then erase one more
"   character.  Stop.
